<!-- Div stands for a content division element. Allows you to group boxes together. -->

<!-------------------------------- DISPLAY PROPERTIES -------------------------------->
<!-- BLOCK elements block out the entire width of the webpage. Ex. Paragraphs, Headers, Divisions, Lists
and List Items, and Forms.  It does not let other elements sit on the same line.  You can set the width of block
elements as you wish.  The default height will be the height of the font size. -->

<!-- INLINE elements only take up as much space as it needs to in height and width. Ex. Spans, Images (actually
more inline-block), Anchors.  Compared to block elements, you cannot change the width of inline elements -->

<!-- INLINE-BLOCK has the best of both worlds.  You can set the width of this type of element as well as
 allow for more than 1 element to sit on the same line.  Images are considered inline-block elements. You can
 change the width and height of images as you wish and they also work as inline elements by being able to be
 next to each other. -->

<!-- Display: NONE - if you change the display value to this, the element will disappear from the page and
will only exist in your code.  To  hide something from your page, you can either do this or use the
visibility: hidden; to hide your code.  The visibility value will hide the element but the space that it
occupied will still be visible. However, if you use display: none, the space that the element occupied will
also disappear. -->

<!-- You can change the type of element by using the display value. -->


<!-------------------------------- POSITIONING -------------------------------->
<!-- STATIC positioning - HTML without any CSS, using the default CSS values of the HTML elements. -->

<!-- RELATIVE positioning - position the element we select relative to how it would have been positioned
had it been static.  For example, let's say a statically positioned image was left-aligned.  If we change the
position of the image to relative and then stated we want to move the image from the left by 30px, the image
will now be shifted from the left edge of the screen toward the center by 30px.
                                        img {
                                            position: relative;
                                            left: 30px;
                                        }
The relative position can be adjusted using top, bottom, left, and right. It's important to note that when
you change the relative position of an element, it does not affect anything else on screen. -->

<!-- ABSOLUTE position - we shift the position of the element relative to its parent.  For example:
                                        <div><img></div>
                                        div {
                                            position: relative;
                                        }
                                        img {
                                            position: absolute;
                                            right: 30px;
                                        }
Let's say the div element takes up the entire line.  If you set the image to absolute positioning and move it right
30px, then the image will go to the right and move from the right edge of the screen over by 30 pixels.  Unlike
relative positioning where it does not affect the positioning of the other elements, once you change an element
to absolute, all the other elements will shift up to take up the space previously occupied by the absolute element.
Note that parent of the absolute positioned element does not have to be the body element.  It can be anything with
a relative position.-->

<!-- FIXED position - this means the element will remain on the same spot on the webpage even if you scroll up or
down. -->
